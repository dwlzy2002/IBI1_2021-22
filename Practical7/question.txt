question:How can we show and compare the total cases data on 2020.3.14?
the code line number:57-73
result:For most countries,the total cases on that day was quite small,less than 1000 in total,which means that at that time the pandemic was not very severe.However, several countries like China, Italy an Iran had cases number above 1000 and even above 8000. These number indicated that these countries were severly affected by COVID-19. Further,on 2020.3.14,China was country having the largest number of cases, whose cases number was more than half of the whole world(compared with the last number named "world" in the plot). That suggested that the sanitary and anti-epidemic affair in China was so important that it can really influence the epidemic control of the whole world.
