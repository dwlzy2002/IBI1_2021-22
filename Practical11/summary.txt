Findings:
human-mouse: 
the alignment score is 1490
the percentage of identical amino acids is 0.9653979238754326

human-random:
the alignment score is -351
the percentage of identical amino acids is 0.02768166089965396

mouse-random:
the alignment score is -348
the percentage of identical amino acids is 0.03114186851211076

seq1(DLX5_human) and seq2(DLX5_mouse) are similar, becasue the BLOSUM score is 1490 and the percentage of identical amino is larger than 0.96.
However, for seq1 and seq3 as well as seq2 and seq3, they are unlike each other. The BLOSUM score for these two comparisons are -351 and -348, respectively. And identical percentage are 0.028 and 0.031. That is to say, the random sequence is unlike the DLX5 gene.   
But the DLX5_ mouse is slightly more like the random sequence, because of the higher score and percentage.
In summay, the genes of the same type or in the same family are generally similar, even from different species.
They can be used simultaneously in the comparison with other sample genes. In this way, We can get more accurate information about the similarity between the sample gene sequence and these genes.
