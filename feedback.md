According to my formative feedback, I changed several things for my code.
Firstly, I added a file called Reflection.txt into my practical 4 folder.
Secondly, I added the code comparing c and d in variables.py which is in the practical 5 folder.
Then, I added other 3 types of X and Y in variables.py.
After that, I added xlabel, ylabel and title for my scatter plot in Parental age vs offspring	health.py which is in practical 6 folder.
Then, I added ylabel to the boxplot in the List	manipulation.py which is in practical 6 folder.
